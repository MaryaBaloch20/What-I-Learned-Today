## Data Types in Python

### Strings
In Python, Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote. In python there is no character data type, a character is a string of length one. It is represented by str class.
for example: `"Hey my name is marya"` this is enclosed in double qoutes.

### Integers
A programming lingo for just whole numbers, numbers without any decimal places.
In order to create an integer all you have to do is just write the number without anything else.
for example: ` 12345 ` is a simple integer.

When talking about large integer numbers, in common human languages we'd like to put commas in between the thousands (large integers).
For example: ` 589,347,697 `
In Python we can replace those commas with underscores like this `547_698_475`and it'll be interpreted by the computer like this `547698475` as if you have written a simple integer. so the computer actually removes those undescores and ignores it.
The benefits is just for us humans to be able to visualize it more easily.

We can also perform mathematical operations on integers such as +, -, *, / and more.

### Float
As mentioned that all the whole numbers no matter if they are positive or negative, are called integers in programming. 
But when the numbers actually have deciman places they are called a float, this is a short for a floating-point number.
for example: number of pi = `3.1415`

### Boolean
The final data type something called Boolean is very simple. It only has two possible values **True or False**.
These values start with capital **T** and capital **F**, they don't have any qoutation marks around them or anything. 
This data type is used a lot in programs to test if something is True or False, and for your program to respond accordingly.
