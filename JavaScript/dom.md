# DOM

## Introduction
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It helps JS to understand what is written on the page and how to manipulate it. It works as a moderator between JS and HTML. 
The DOM defines in a heirarichal form to make it understandable for the JS, so that other JS functions can be used on it. It represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.

Dom is not used with JS only, it is used with other languages as well such as Python. It is used to make web pages interactive and provide dynamic behavior. It is also used to create and modify the structure and content of the document.
