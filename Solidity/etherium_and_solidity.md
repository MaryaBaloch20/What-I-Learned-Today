## A Short History Lesson

**October 31, 2008 -** Date of the original Bitcoin whitepaper

It is actually an academic paper that is referred as a White Paper.
This paper was released by **Satoshi Nakamoto.**

The paper paper described the creation of a system that would allow people to pay each other directly without the need of a central authority like a bank.
Out of this paper the Bitcoin network was eventually brought online in January of 2009, and this is the original Bitcoin Network. One of the key characteristics of the Bitcoin network was the idea of a **block chain.**

The Bitcoin block chain was a tool to store a list of monetary transactions between different people. The Bitcoin network thrived and continues to thrive today. However, the only purpose of Bitcoin was to enable financial transactions. That was it, send money from person A to B. Not long after its release, many people realized that they could use some of Bitcoins original innovations to not only handle the transfer of currency, but other types of exchanges as well.

So one person who felt very strongly about this was named **Retallack Budarin.**
Then he authored a white paper of his own. Again, a white paper is essentially an academic document, and **he published it back in late 2013.**
He was a proponent of the Bitcoin project, but he thought that the Bitcoin project was too simple in nature. He envisioned using block to block chain technology to create far more complex applications. In fact, he describes using a theorem to create sub crypto currencies, domain name registration systems and gambling applications. So, He didn't want to just use Bitcoin to transfer money. He wanted to figure out some way to use these innovations to create much more advanced applications.
Inside of his white paper, it goes on to describe the most important part of the theorem network, something called a **smart contract.**
A smart contract is a piece of code that lives in the theory and block chain. This contract can be instructed to do certain things by having a person or another contract send a message to it.

The **theorem system eventually went online on July 30th of 2015**, and it also continues to flourish to this day.
